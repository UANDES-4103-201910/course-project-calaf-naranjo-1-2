# WEB-TECHNOLOGIES-LAB-ASSIGNMENT-2

For this assignment, it has been developed a basic view of the web page of the project. 

//IMPORTANT//

1) The evaluation for this assignment, is a demonstration of the models of the complete project 

2) In the creation of a new User, if this one it is saved correctly, the page will be redirect to the layout that creates a new Profile. Here it is asked to put an User, for this it is required the recently created User ID. It is very probably that the value for this be 1. If not, it can be reviwed in the Rails console (we are actually working to fix this issue).

4) There still few elements that we hope to have them ready for the final demo (this week)

5) There are example users and admins already created. They have the following attributes to use:
        email: admin1@asd.cl and password:123456789
        email: user1@asd.cl  and password:123456789
        email: admin2@asd.cl and password:123456789
        email: user2@asd.cl  and password:123456789
        email: admin3@asd.cl and password:123456789
        email: user3@asd.cl  and password:123456789
        
7) To start the evaluation, run in the terminal the next command:
            $ rails db:reset 
            
8) A new user will be a normal user and not admin by default
